## General rules
- *if* clause 
- If ... *,* ... | But | ... If ... (No comma)


### Zero conditional 
Things are certain, *[[Слова 5 (50 слов)#^54235c|inevitable]]*

Connectors:
	- If
	- when

Structure:
	- If + present simple, present simple

#### Example
- If you heat ice, it melts
- Water boils if you heat it at 100 degrees 

### First conditional
The things in the future which are *likely to happen or have a real possibility* of happening

Connectors: 
	- If
	- When (at some point after)
	- As soon as (immediately after)
	- as long as (on the condition that)
	- Unless (Except if)
	- In case 
	- After

Structure:
	- If + present simple, will + infinitive 

#### Example
- *I will write* you at Sunday, *in case* you *don't contact* me.

### Second conditional


**Were’ instead of ‘was’**: When there is the verb _to be_ in the _if clause_, we can change it from was to _were_ (more preferable).

As you can see, in the if clause we use the past simple, and in the main clause we use the conditional _would_. We can also use the word _could_ to mean a hypothetical possibility.

The second conditional refers to the present or the future, and is used to talk about anything _**unlikely**_ to happen. Imagine meeting Lionel Messi, or finding a million dollars on the floor.

Structure:
	- If + past simple,… would/wouldn’t + infinitive

Connectors:
	- if
#### Example
- If I were you, I would tell him
### Third conditional
We often use the third conditional to talk about _**regrets**_, and it is based on an unreal situation that cannot be changed.

Structure:
	- If + past perfect, …would/wouldn’t + have + past participle.

#### Example
- You would never have met Jamie if you hadn't gone to the same school


### Mixed conditionals
The most common is to mix the third and the second to create a present result of a past conditional.

#### Example
- If you **had listened** to me (_past_), we **wouldn't be lost** (_present_)
- If you **had come** to the meeting, you **would know** all this information about the project

These sentences express that if something had been different in the past, something would be different now in the present.
